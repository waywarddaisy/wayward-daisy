    This is a petite sized arrangement with up to 30 stems.</p>
<p>Every arrangement is a celebration of the season, with each flower being handpicked
    and placed to show off the fruits of our beautiful San Diego sunshine.</p>
<p>Flowers are grown right here on my micro flower farm in Vista, where they are started
    from seed each season.</p>
<p>I use ceramic vessels and for something extra special there is an option for you to
    choose vessels handmade by me at home and are glazed with non-toxic food safe glaze so
    that when they are eventually returned to the earth, there is no toxicity.</p>
<p>Local flowers not only are beautiful, but they come with other benefits that are not prevalent
    in imported flowers such as lovely scents which have been scientifically proven to improve health and
    mood.</p>`,

    productInfoHTML:`<p>Looking to start your own cut flower garden but have so many questionsâ€¦ this consultation is for you!</p>
    <p>I'm here to answer all of your burning questions so bring that list!</p>
    <p>For the past 5 years I have honed the flower growing skills specifically for our climate right here in San Diego. 
        I have produced enough cut flowers to sell to Flower Shops and Florists all over the county as well as making my own designs.</p>
    <p>Whether you have lots of experience or just a few pots to grow in, you can grow cut flowers and you should! The joy it will bring you is so worth it, 
        not to mention how much our planet needs more green spaces right now.</p>
    <p>After purchase we will set up a time for a 30 minute zoom call or audio call, whatever is your preference. For in person consultations, 
        you must be within San Diego County and I will spend an hour, to an hour and a half at your home with follow up emails and resources.</p>
    <p>Scheduling will take place via email after purchase.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to helping you grow something beautiful!</p>`,

    productInfoHTML:`<p>Creating the Daisy Centerpiece was a labor of love, I wanted it to be both elegant, 
    but also modern and fun. When nothing is in it, it looks like a little daisy or a 
    pig snout depending on who you ask. Either way I love that it is fun, cute and simple.</p>
<p>I created this piece using hand building slab techniques as well as throwing on the pottery wheel. 
    I wanted to create something that could be used on a dinner table, or even the kitchen island to 
    make the meal or holiday dinner more intimate and magical without having to have many flowers as 
    flower production slows down this time of year.</p>
<p>A few fresh flowers, or even dried flowers, or foliage you have foraged from your yard or garden is 
    plenty to make the table festive.</p>
<p>The centerpiece is not only wonderful for the holiday season, but I hope it will continue to be a part 
    of your most precious celebrations from Valentines Day, Easter, Birthday Celebrations and even summer nights. </p>
<p>You can purchase with or without candles. I find that the color of the candles helps to make up for any color that may 
    be lacking without flowers when just foliage or dried florals are used. </p>
<p>It is approximately 8 inches wide in all directions and up to 5 inches tall. No two pieces are identical. 
    Shipping is included in the price and candles can be added on separately. </p>
<p>Flowers are not included. Purchase just includes the ceramic centerpiece and candles if they are chosen to be added on. </p>
<p>Note: There may be small cracks in the glazed surface of the centerpiece due to the handmade nature of the item and the hand-built nature of it.  
    While they are kept to a minimum, they are part of its character. </p>`,
