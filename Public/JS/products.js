"I created this piece using hand building slab techniques as well as throwing on the pottery wheel. I wanted to create something that could be used on a dinner table, or even the kitchen island to make the meal or holiday dinner more intimate and magical without having to have many flowers as flower production slows down this time of year.",
"A few fresh flowers, or even dried flowers, or foliage you have foraged from your yard or garden is plenty to make the table festive.",
"The centerpiece is not only wonderful for the holiday season, but I hope it will continue to be a part of your most precious celebrations from Valentines Day, Easter, Birthday Celebrations and even summer nights.", 
"You can purchase with or without candles. I find that the color of the candles helps to make up for any color that may be lacking without flowers when just foliage or dried florals are used.", 
"It is approximately 8 inches wide in all directions and up to 5 inches tall. No two pieces are identical. Shipping is included in the price and candles can be added on separately.", 
"Flowers are not included. Purchase just includes the ceramic centerpiece and candles if they are chosen to be added on.", 
"Note: There may be small cracks in the glazed surface of the centerpiece due to the handmade nature of the item and the hand-built nature of it. While they are kept to a minimum, they are part of its character." ],
