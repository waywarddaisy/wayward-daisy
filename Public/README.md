##Title: 

Wayward Daisy Flowers. The goal of this project was to create the front end of a website for a floral and ceramics company which gives information about the company and its products as well as allows the customers to browse products and purchase them. 

##Technologies Used: 

I used HTML, CSS and javascript for this project. Much of the HTML was created dynamically through javascript so that it can be easily updated and so it could be written more efficiently without having to repeat code for each different product. The Shop pages display products dynamically as does the individual product-pages which display the product, according to which product was clicked on the shop page. 

The header which includes the logo and navigation was also created dynamically so that less code is used and any future changes are done more efficiently. 

I used git throughout the project for version control. 

##Challenges: 

Some of the more challenging things I faced were decrementing and incrementing the quantities in the shopping cart, I had to make sure all of the other totals were updated when the quantities were changed. I also linked the quanity to the inventory amount so that customers couldnt purchase more than was in-stock. Another one was the site search, I had to make sure to refresh the value to make sure it was cleared out after each search, that it displayed "no results" when there werent any and that the search term and the search target were both changed to lower case to ensure results could be found. 

##Future: 

I plan to add some features in the the future such as an added to cart success message, have the cart icon show when there is an item in the cart, newsletter signup and full payment acceptance. 

I have created this project entirely on my own the exception of the server which was created with guidance from another developer because I am not currently familiar with the back end.
