    <h3>Hi, I'm Jenna!</h3>
    <p>I'm the Flower Farmer and Florist behind Wayward Daisy!</p>
    <p>I live in Vista, North San Diego County about fifteen minutes from the beach on 1/3-acre of land with my husband, little boy, little girl and a cat and dog. We have fruit trees, a micro suburban flower farm, and a little casita where we all live messily, 
        but happily, together.</p>
    <p>I specialize in growing flowers that grow well in our beautiful climate and create seasonal, garden inspired arrangements with them, 
        in handmade ceramic vases which I also make.</p>
    <p>Every year I search out new varieties and start them from seed, corm, or tuber every flower that will eventually wind up in your vase. 
        Some of my favorites are Ranunculus, Anemone, Iceland Poppies, Zinnias, Cosmos and Dahlias.</p>
    <p>I grow everything organically and without the use of any harmful chemicals or pesticides.</p>
    <p>Growing flowers is so fulfilling for me. I hope you enjoy my flowers as much as I enjoy growing them.</p>
